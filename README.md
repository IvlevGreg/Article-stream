## Project architecture

Project was written depends on Feature Sliced Design methodology.

Docs link - [Features Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/ru/docs/get-started/overview)

---

## Work with translation

Project using `i18next` library for translations. The translation files are stored
in [public/locales](./public/locales/).
A convenient file system of translations is provided, which makes it easy to introduce a new language: create a
directory with the desired language, edit the [i18next configuration](./src/shared/config/i18n/i18n.ts) a bit and create
translations manually using the appropriate keys.

For comfortable working with translations strongly recommend to install vscode/web-storm extension. For vscode link
provided: [click me](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally)

i18next docs - [https://react.i18next.com/latest/using-with-hooks](https://react.i18next.com/latest/using-with-hooks)

---

## Testing

Project has 3 types of tests:

1) Unit testing uses jest with the usual mocks of data and libraries
2) Integration testing with React Testing Library in
   jest-dom, [testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) is used, and for
   isolated components
3) Regression screenshot storybook testing. I use  [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) solution

## CI pipeline and pre-commit hooks

Config for GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows`. CI used to run linters, tests, build
project and storybook, upload unit & screenshot reports to GitHub Pages.

In precommit hooks we check the project with linters, config in /.husky

---

## Working with data

Data interaction is handled by @reduxjs/toolkit. Reusable entities can be normalized using EntityAdapter, which allows
to obtain O(n) data access complexity.

Requests to the backend are sent using both [axios](https://axios-http.com/en/docs/intro)
and [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)

JSON-server was used for backend in the application, as well as the basic data in the form of filling articles,
comments, notifications, users and profiles were filled manually, due to the absence of backend. Can write a
full-fledged backend in NestJS, for example, together with the editor of articles with the help of some library.

For async reducers loading, used [DynamicModuleWrapper](/src/shared/lib/components/DynamicModuleWrapper.tsx)

It allows asynchronous loading of reducers, thus getting rid of them in the main bundle

---

## Project configuration

For development project has 2 configs:

1. Webpack config - [./config/build](/config/build/), [webpack.config.ts](/webpack.config.ts)

The project configuration is stored in [/config](/config/)

- */config/babel* - babel configuration
- */config/build* - Webpack configuration. Resolvers, plugins, DevServer, Loaders are stored here
- */config/jest* - jest environment config
- */config/storybook* - storybook configuration

---

## Storybook

Project using storybook to describe components views.
The storybook-addon-mock is used for mock requests from backend.

The storybook file is in the same directory as the component it describes and has pattern like **.stories.tsx**

The storybook is started with the following script - `npm run storybook`

More about storybook - [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install/)

Additional decorators to make the storybook work with the libraries used in the project are
written [here.](/src/shared/config/storybook/)
